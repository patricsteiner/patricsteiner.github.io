This is a summary of the talk [How to think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fB8GRotdrc) by Andr√© Staltz. He compares the human thinking process to the one of a computer and explains some tips on how to come up with good ideas.

## Why thinking is hard

- Humans naturally imitate each other (do what others do to get approval)
- We have feelings that distract from thinking
- We have a _very_ limited working memory, that auto-flushes every couple seconds

## How to improve the thinking process

- Never immediately dismiss an idea, just because it is not _the way_. Give it at least 10 seconds.
- Acknowledge your feelings. It makes no sense to be completely frustrated searching that bug for 8 hours. Take a break, refresh your mind.
- Improve your memory with tools. Write thoughts down, give it some structure.

### Brain-computer analogy

- Thinking is basically an algorithm.
- An algorithm on the computer does not work without a data structure.
- Choosing the right data structure is crucial.

The same goes for your brain! Choose a fitting data structure to support your thinking process. Mindmaps are a good option.
Write problems down, but don't dismiss an idea just because there is a problem. There might be a solution for the problem. And then there might be a problem again, but then again, maybe there is a simple solution that applies in our specific case.
