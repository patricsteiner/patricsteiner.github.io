A story about a new side project.

### Day one: 08.09.2024.

I have been enormously absorbed working on [Jobeagle](https://jobeagle.io) the last 2.5 years. I don't think I have ever had such a long streak NOT having any side-project... But yesterday evening I had the sudden urge to start something new. I didn't even have an idea yet. So I brainstormed for around 2 minutes and thought "why not do some workout app?". Sort of stupid, because there are already thousands out there. But even though I have been working out for 10 years now, I have never, NEVER used any workout app. Never needed one. So exactly zero reasons to build one ðŸ˜‚. But hey, I didn't even care about what to build, I just wanted to make something fresh. 

So the first hour was obviously wasted on finding a name + domain. I wanted something with "wod" in it (workout of the day), and eventually settled on [wodz.me](https://wodz.me). I initially wanted a .club domain, but since they cost more than 5$, I obviously went for the cheaper option of .me for 2$, which is also cool.

Ok great, so I now have a domain, but still zero idea what my product should even do. 

Whatever, I thought, let's just set up a new Angular project and go with the flow.

I did exactly that, and 2 hours later I had this beauty online: A server side rendered Angular app hosted on the new experimental firebase app hosting (which sadly only seems to be only available in the US datacenter for now) using tailwind, which has been on my list for a while now.

**What I achieved:**

- A fresh Angular app is up and running, server-side rendered with prettier and tailwind set up
- A cool bear logo (obviously AI generated)
- A Button that generates a random (tough) workout using gemini 1.5 flash (it is so good!)

**Time spent: 3 hours**
