So this is how it finally starts. Being a passionate computer scientist forces me to learn so many new things everyday to keep up with the rapidly chaning IT world - which is great! I love learning new things, I love learning about the future. However, the downside is that it is rather hard to keep so much information in my head and not forget it over the years. Therefore, starting today, I will write down the most important and interesting things I learn and do, not only to strengthen my own synapses, but also to make the information available to anyone in the world who might be interested in all of the various topics yet to follow.
