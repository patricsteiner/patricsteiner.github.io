### Random fact #1: How our lungs work - 19.04.2020
Humans have two lungs which are directly in front of the heart. The lungs are comparable to a balloon filled with a sponge. When we breathe in, the air goes through the trachea (Luftr√∂hre in german). Mucus in the trachea prevents dust etc. to get into the lungs. From the trachea the air goes into the lungs, which are structured like a tree that branches into smaller and smaller pipes (called bronchioles), until eventually the air gets into little air sacks called alveoli. These air sacks are surrounded by capillares filled with red blood cells, containing a protein called hemoglobin. Because of diffusion (molecules in gas move where there is a lower concentration of their kind) the C02 in the blood will be unloaded into the lungs (and later exhaled) and the 02 will go to the hemoglobin and transported through the body via the bloodstream.

Sidenote: For people who have asthma, the cartilage rings in the trachea collapse, which makes it harder for air to go through. Medicine helps to open it back up.
